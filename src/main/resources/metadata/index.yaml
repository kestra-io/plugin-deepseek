title: "Run DeepSeek chat and JSON completions"
description: "Tasks that call DeepSeek chat models for conversational or schema-guided JSON responses."
body: "Use DeepSeek ChatCompletion to orchestrate role-based conversations or JSON-only replies within Kestra Flows. Requires `apiKey`, `modelName`, and `messages`; defaults `baseUrl` to `https://api.deepseek.com/v1` for OpenAI-compatible routing. Add `jsonResponseSchema` to enable JSON Mode with a prepended schema reminder; DeepSeek treats the schema as guidance rather than server-side validation."
